# MEMORY GAME:

Kevin Kurpe developed this MEMORY GAME for Andrew Kolas at Custom, Ink.

## Challenge
We want you to create a Memory Wordle on your computer that can be played by at least one person at a time.
You may implement the game in whichever user interface(e.g., browser, console, GTK, etc.) and language(s) you choose.
You may also feel free to use any libraries, plugins, or frameworks that may be helpful.

## Rules
Rules to the game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game)

At the beginning of the game, there are some cards on the board that are all facedown,
i.e., their symbol is not visible, and all the cards look the same.

A players turn consists of the following:
- A player turns over a card making its symbol visible.
- That player turns over a second card making its symbol visible.
- If the symbols from both cards match, the cards remain face up. When a match occurs, the player's turn continues.
- If the symbols do not match, the player is given a moment to observe the cards before they are placed face down. When the cards don't match, the player's turn ends.

Card symbols all come in pairs.
